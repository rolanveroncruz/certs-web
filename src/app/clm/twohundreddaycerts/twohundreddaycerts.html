    200 Day Certificates in 2026
  </div>
  <div class="twohundreddaycerts-text">
    <p> You’ve likely seen the headlines: 47-day certificates by 2029. But that’s not the full picture.</p>
    <br>
    <p> In less than 6 months, the new standard will require renewals every 200 days (i.e. 6 months).
      With twice the workload for renewals the near future, CLM tools become necessary for ensuring
      every certificate is managed properly and renewed on-time.</p>
